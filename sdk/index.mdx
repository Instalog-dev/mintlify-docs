## Core Features

All Instalog SDKs provide the following core features:

### Event Logging
Track custom events with flexible parameters to understand user behavior and application usage patterns.

```js
// Example (syntax varies by platform)
Instalog.log('button_clicked', { screen: 'HomeScreen' });
```

### User Identification
Associate events and crashes with specific users to trace issues to individual accounts.

```js
// Example (syntax varies by platform)
Instalog.identifyUser('user_email@example.com');
```

### Crash Reporting
Automatically detect and report crashes with detailed stack traces and device information.

### Feedback Collection
Collect user feedback directly within your app using our customizable feedback modal.
