## Event Logging Strategy

### Consistency in Event Naming

Use a consistent naming convention for events across your application:

- Use descriptive, action-oriented names (e.g., `user_registered`, `payment_processed`)
- Avoid generic names like `click` or `view`
- Utilize namespaces for better organization (e.g., `auth.login_success`, `payment.transaction_failed`)

```javascript
// Good
instalog.log('payment_processed', { amount: 99.99, currency: 'USD' });

// Better
instalog.log('payment.transaction_completed', { 
  amount: 99.99, 
  currency: 'USD',
  method: 'credit_card',
  status: 'success'
});
```

### Structured Metadata

Include relevant metadata with each event to provide context:

- Always include identifiers (user ID, session ID, etc.)
- Add relevant business metrics (transaction amount, subscription tier, etc.)
- Include environmental context (device info, app version, etc.)

## User Identification

### Implement Early and Consistently

Identify users as early as possible in their session:

```kotlin
// After user authentication
instalog.identifyUser("user123");
```

### Anonymize Sensitive Data

Never log personal identifiable information (PII) directly:

- Use anonymized identifiers
- Hash or tokenize sensitive information
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Crash Reporting

### Group Similar Errors

Configure error grouping to reduce noise in your error reports:

```javascript
// Configure error grouping during initialization
await Instalog.initialize('YOUR_API_KEY', {
  errorGrouping: {
    enabled: true,
    errorThreshold: 5,
    timeWindowMs: 60000
  }
});
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Initialize SDK as early as possible in app lifecycle
- [ ] Identify users after authentication
- [ ] Implement consistent event naming strategy
- [ ] Include relevant metadata with all events
- [ ] Set up proper error grouping
- [ ] Configure appropriate log levels
- [ ] Test crash reporting in development
- [ ] Monitor dashboard regularly for issues
- [ ] Implement automated alerts for critical errors

## Integration with MCP

When using Model Context Protocol with Instalog:

- Structure your queries to be specific and focused
- Include time ranges when querying historical data
- Use natural language to describe the patterns you're looking for
- Leverage MCP for automated analysis of recurring issues
