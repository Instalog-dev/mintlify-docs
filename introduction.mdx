## Fast logging for vibe-coders

Let's face it - your app is probably a dumpster fire of bugs and user confusion. Instalog is here to help you pretend you know what you're doing.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Mobile SDKs"
    icon="mobile-screen"
    href="/sdk"
  >
    Because apparently you can't just use console.log() in production
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="API Reference"
    icon="code"
    href="/api-reference"
  >
    For when you want to pretend you're a "real" developer
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Available SDKs

We made SDKs for all the platforms you're probably using wrong:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Android SDK"
    icon="android"
    href="/sdk/android"
  >
    For when your app crashes more than your self-esteem
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="iOS SDK"
    icon="apple"
    href="/sdk/ios"
  >
    Because Swift errors are just Objective-C's way of saying "I told you so"
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="React Native SDK"
    icon="react"
    href="/sdk/react-native"
  >
    For when you want cross-platform but get cross-eyed instead
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Flutter SDK"
    icon="mobile"
    href="/sdk/flutter"
  >
    Because sometimes you just want to pretend you're using React
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Features We're Not Ashamed Of

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Event Logging"
    icon="chart-line"
  >
    Track every time your users question their life choices
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Crash Reporting"
    icon="bug"
  >
    Because your code is more bug than feature
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="User Feedback"
    icon="message"
  >
    Collect all those lovely "WTF is this?" comments
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Real-time Monitoring"
    icon="gauge-high"
  >
    Watch your app burn in real-time
  </Card>
  <Card

    Because you can't decide which platform to fail on
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Easy Integration"
    icon="puzzle-piece"

    It's so easy even your PM could do it (but don't let them)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started (Because We Know You Need Help)

1. [Sign up](https://beta.instalog.dev/signup) - it's free, unlike your dignity
2. Get your API key - it's like a password, but for your failures
3. Install the SDK - because copy-pasting from Stack Overflow isn't enough
4. Initialize the SDK - it's like turning on the lights before you trip
5. Start logging events - because someone needs to document this mess

For detailed instructions, visit our [SDK documentation](/sdk). Or don't, we're not your mom.
