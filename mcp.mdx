## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables secure, two-way connections between AI models and data sources. It allows AI assistants like Claude to directly interact with Instalog's logging and analytics features, providing enhanced context and functionality.

With MCP integration, you can:

- Query Instalog data directly through AI assistants
- Analyze logs and events without switching between tools
- Generate insights from your application's event data
- Troubleshoot issues more efficiently with contextual information

## Installing Instalog MCP

To integrate Instalog with MCP-compatible AI tools, run the following command:

```bash
npx @mintlify/mcp add instalog
```

During installation, you'll be prompted for authentication:

```
> What is the Authorization (basic token)?
```

Enter your Instalog API key, which you can find in your [Instalog dashboard](https://beta.instalog.dev/dashboard) under API Keys.

## Starting the MCP Server

After installation, start your MCP server with:

```bash
npm --prefix ~/.mcp/instalog start
```

This will launch the Instalog MCP server locally, allowing MCP clients to connect to your Instalog data.

## Connecting to AI Tools

### Claude Desktop App

To use the Instalog MCP server with Claude:

1. In the Claude Desktop App, navigate to **Settings > Developer**
2. Click on **Edit Config**
3. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "instalog": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": [
        "--prefix",
        "~/.mcp/instalog",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Look for the hammer icon in Claude, which indicates available MCP tools
5. You can now use natural language to query your Instalog data

## Example Queries

Once connected, you can ask Claude questions like:

- "Show me all error events from the past 24 hours"
- "What are the most common user actions in my app?"
- "Display crash reports for the iOS app from last week"
- "Analyze the trend of login failures over the past month"
